js-tools
========

Just some simple tools in JavaScript that I've built over the years for a variety of use cases.

Right now, there are only two but I'll keep adding more. These are hosted on <a href="https://dangoldin.github.io/js-tools/">http://dangoldin.github.io/js-tools/</a>. Feel free to fork and add your own or provide suggestions.

1. Convert a delimited text table into a Bootstrap formatted HTML table. This is useful when copying and pasting data from Excel that you want to display as a Bootstrap table.
2. Bulk geodecoding. Convert a list of addresses to latitude and longitude.
3. Generate a BCG style "growth-share" matrix. The UI is currently a bit clunky but the goal is to help generate a chart that you can then take a screenshot of and use wherever.
4. SQL data generation. This generates a bunch of dummy inserts into a specified table.
5. SQL schema comparison. Compare two dumps of a SQL schema.
6. SQL query formatter. Format a SQL query.
7. Date generation. Generate a series of dates between a date range using a step function for a specific format.
8. Kafka partition diff. Visualize the difference in Kafka partition assignments.
